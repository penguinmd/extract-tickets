# ASMG Units Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive ASMG (Anesthesia Service Management Group) units calculation system with temporal rules management. The system calculates ASMG units for each case based on configurable rules that can change over time, providing flexibility for different calculation methods across different date ranges.

## ASMG Units Formula

### Calculation Formula
**ASMG Units = (Anes Units Multiplier × Total Anes Units) + (Total Anes Time ÷ Anes Time Divisor) + (Med Units Multiplier × Total Med Units)**

### Default Rule (Effective 1/1/2025)
- **Anes Units Multiplier**: 0.5
- **Anes Time Divisor**: 10.0
- **Med Units Multiplier**: 0.6

## Database Structure

### ASMGTemporalRules Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE asmg_temporal_rules (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    effective_date DATE NOT NULL,           -- Date when rule becomes effective
    anes_units_multiplier REAL NOT NULL,   -- Multiplier for anesthesia base units
    anes_time_divisor REAL NOT NULL,       -- Divisor for anesthesia time
    med_units_multiplier REAL NOT NULL,    -- Multiplier for medical base units
    description TEXT,                      -- Optional description
    created_at DATETIME,                   -- When rule was created
    updated_at DATETIME                    -- When rule was last updated
);
```

### Rule Application Logic
- Rules are applied based on case date of service
- The most recent rule with an effective date ≤ the case date is used
- If no rule exists for a case date, default values are used
- Each effective date can have only one rule (unique constraint)

## User Interface Features

### ASMG Rules Management Page (`/asmg_rules`)
- **Add/Update Rule Form**: Easy-to-use form with validation
- **Formula Display**: Clear explanation of ASMG calculation
- **Rules Table**: View all existing rules with effective dates
- **Delete Functionality**: Remove rules with confirmation
- **Form Validation**: Prevents invalid inputs (zero divisors, negative multipliers)

### Cases Page Updates
- **New Column Order**: Ticket Number → ASMG Units → DOS → Start Time → CPT Code → Other fields
- **ASMG Units Display**: Shows calculated ASMG units with 2 decimal places
- **Sortable ASMG Column**: Sort cases by ASMG units ascending/descending
- **Real-time Calculation**: ASMG units calculated dynamically based on case date

### Navigation
- Added "ASMG Rules" link in main navigation
- Accessible from any page in the application

## Key Features

### Temporal Rule Management
- **Date-based Rules**: Different calculation methods for different time periods
- **Automatic Rule Selection**: System automatically selects applicable rule based on case date
- **Rule Override**: New rules can override existing ones for the same effective date
- **Rule History**: Track when rules were created and last updated

### Dynamic Calculation
- **Real-time Computation**: ASMG units calculated on-demand for each case
- **Date-aware Logic**: Uses appropriate rule based on case date of service
- **Fallback Handling**: Uses default values if no applicable rule found
- **Performance Optimized**: Efficient database queries for rule lookup

### User Experience
- **Intuitive Interface**: Clean, responsive design for rule management
- **Form Validation**: Prevents common input errors
- **Confirmation Dialogs**: Safe deletion with user confirmation
- **Clear Documentation**: Formula explanation and usage instructions

## Usage Instructions

### For Users
1. **View ASMG Units**: Visit `/cases` page to see calculated ASMG units for all cases
2. **Manage Rules**: Visit `/asmg_rules` to add, edit, or delete calculation rules
3. **Add New Rule**: Use the form to create rules for new time periods
4. **Update Existing Rule**: Modify rules by entering the same effective date
5. **Delete Rules**: Remove rules using the delete button (with confirmation)

### For Developers
1. **Initialize System**: Run `python migrate_asmg_rules.py` to set up tables and default rules
2. **Calculate ASMG Units**: Use `ASMGCalculator.calculate_asmg_units()` method
3. **Manage Rules**: Use `ASMGCalculator` methods for CRUD operations
4. **Custom Rules**: Add application-specific rules through the web interface

## Technical Implementation

### Rule Application Algorithm
1. Get case date of service
2. Query rules table for rules with effective_date ≤ case_date
3. Order by effective_date descending (most recent first)
4. Use first (most recent) rule found
5. Apply formula with rule parameters
6. Return calculated ASMG units

### Error Handling
- **Missing Rules**: Uses default values if no applicable rule found
- **Invalid Inputs**: Form validation prevents invalid rule creation
- **Database Errors**: Graceful error handling with user feedback
- **Calculation Errors**: Returns 0.0 for ASMG units if calculation fails

### Performance Considerations
- **Efficient Queries**: Optimized database queries for rule lookup
- **Caching**: Rules are queried efficiently for each case
- **Scalability**: System handles multiple rules and large case datasets

## Migration and Deployment

### Database Migration
- Successfully created ASMG rules table
- Initialized with default rule (effective 1/1/2025)
- Preserved existing case data
- Backward compatible with existing functionality

### Testing
- ✅ Database migration completed successfully
- ✅ Default rules initialized
- ✅ Web interface loads correctly
- ✅ Rule management functionality works
- ✅ ASMG units calculated and displayed in cases table
- ✅ Navigation and routing functional

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features

2. **Bulk Rule Import**: Import multiple rules from CSV/Excel
3. **Rule Validation**: Advanced validation for rule consistency
4. **Rule History**: Track changes to rules over time
5. **Export Functionality**: Export ASMG calculations to reports

### Technical Improvements
1. **Performance Optimization**: Add database indexes for faster rule lookup
2. **Caching**: Implement rule caching for better performance
3. **API Endpoints**: REST API for programmatic rule management
4. **Audit Trail**: Track who created/modified rules and when

## Conclusion

The ASMG units implementation provides a robust, flexible system for calculating anesthesia service management group units based on temporal rules. The system successfully handles multiple calculation methods across different time periods, provides an intuitive management interface, and integrates seamlessly with the existing cases system. The implementation is production-ready and provides a solid foundation for future enhancements.
